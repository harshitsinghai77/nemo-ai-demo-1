## PR Title
Ensure financial agent returns correct and complete information for stock-related queries

---

### Story Context
This PR addresses the requirement to ensure that the financial agent returns accurate and complete financial data for stock-related queries. Specifically, when a user asks for the current stock price and fundamentals of a company like Apple, the `/agent` endpoint should provide the current stock price, at least one fundamental metric, and ensure the response is not generic or hallucinated. The response should also include markdown formatting if applicable.

### Changes Made
- **Modified Files:**
  - `./tmp/finance_service_agent/controllers/agents.py`: Enhanced the `financial_agent` and `multi_ai` agent to ensure they provide accurate financial data.
  - `./tmp/finance_service_agent/routes/agentRoutes.py`: Updated the `/agent` endpoint to format responses properly and added validation logic for stock-related queries.

- **New/Modified Functions:**
  - `is_stock_related_query` in `agentRoutes.py`: Determines if a query is related to stocks or financial data.
  - `validate_stock_response` in `agentRoutes.py`: Validates if a response contains required stock information.

- **Major Logic Changes:**
  - Added detailed instructions and role updates for the `financial_agent` to ensure it always provides stock prices and fundamental metrics.
  - Updated the `multi_ai` agent to prioritize financial data from the `financial_agent`.
  - Implemented a retry mechanism in the `/agent` endpoint if the initial response doesn't contain required information.
  - Added specialized error handling for stock-related queries.
