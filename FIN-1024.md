## Create a new route inside the agentRoutes.py which takes two numbers from the query parameter and return the sum of it in JSON format, with keys like num1, num2, total

### Story Context
This change was required to add a new API endpoint that calculates the sum of two numbers provided as query parameters. The endpoint should return the result in JSON format with the specified keys.

### Changes Made
- Modified `agentRoutes.py` to add a new route `/sum` that accepts two numbers as query parameters (`num1` and `num2`).
- Implemented parameter validation to ensure both parameters are provided and are valid numbers.
- Calculated the sum of the two numbers and returned the result in JSON format with keys `num1`, `num2`, and `total`.
- Added HTML response handling for browser requests to provide documentation for the new endpoint.
- Updated the documentation in the HTML template for the new route.

### Technical Notes
- Added a dependency function `validate_number_params` to handle parameter validation and conversion.
- Created a helper function `convert_to_number` that intelligently converts values to int or float based on content.
- Used FastAPI's `Query` parameter to provide better documentation.
- Separated the validation logic from the route handler for better separation of concerns.
- Pre-computed the example response JSON to avoid repeated `json.dumps` calls.
- Used FastAPI's dependency injection system for better code organization.
- Optimized browser detection logic.
- Used FastAPI's HTTPException for proper error responses.

### Testing & Validation
- Updated tests to cover the new route and ensure it behaves as expected.
- Manual testing was performed to verify the endpoint's functionality and response format.
