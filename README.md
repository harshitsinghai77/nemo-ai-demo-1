A FastAPI REST API server built using FastAPI and Agno AI. The server configuration has routes handlers to fetch latest data of the stock tickers. It also interacts with the Agno AI to get the predictions for the stock prices, answers to the queries, and use tools like `search`, `get_stock_data`, and `get_stock_price`.
